🧬 Tweak transmission rate, recovery rate, death rate, number of people, and many more! 🧬

⚙️ Graphical User Interface with sliders and buttons. ⚙️

👁️ Visual and graphical interpretation of results from the simulation 👁️

🔬 Randomized simulation 🔬

🧫 Inspired by [SEIDR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) 🧫

## Features

* Every parameters of the simulation is editable through an interactive GUI 🖥
* Humans are travelling randomly but logically and are represented by dots 👦
* Humans can wear a mask and mask are 80% effective 🧢
* Humans wearing a mask are represented by a "+" and do not easily infect as well as being harder to infect ⛑️
* The simulation is almost fully randomized but keeps logic with given values 🎲
* You can adjust the speed of the simulation with the slider 🏃
* You can tweak some specific parameters of the simulation 🧰
* At the end of the simulation, you can see the evolution of the population through time 📊
* ... and many more! 🎯

## Demo

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+ (3.0+ might work)

Get a copy of the Project. Assuming you have git installed, open your Terminal and enter:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/marcpinet/epidemic-modeling.git'
```

To install all needed requirements run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running 🏃

After that you can proceed to start the program by running `main.py`.

## Contributions

Special thanks to [loicpantano](https://github.com/loicpantano) for some ideas and [marcusaasjensen](https://github.com/marcusaasjensen) for its participation in the project (he made a its own simulation in C# of an airport with graphs, see [marcus' simulation](https://github.com/marcusaasjensenunice/covid-simulation)).

We were in the same team for this project and we worked together on different programs.
