🧬 Tweak transmission rate, recovery rate, death rate, number of people, and many more! 🧬

⚙️ Graphical User Interface with sliders and buttons. ⚙️

👁️ Visual and graphical interpretation of results from the simulation 👁️

🔬 Fully randomized simulation 🔬

🧫 Inspired by [SEIR Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) 🧫

## Features

* Every parameters of the simulation is editable through an interactive GUI 🖥
* Humans are moving randomly but logically and are represented by dots 👦
* Humans can wear a mask and mask are 80% effective 🧢
* Humans wearing a mask are represented by a "+" and do not easily infect as well as being harder to infect ⛑️
* The simulation is fully randomized but keeps logic with given values 🎲
* At the end of the simulation, you can see the evolution of the population through time 📊
* You can adjust the speed simulation with the slider 🏃
* You can choose whether dots collide between each other or not 🎯
